A Sample GSSAPI Client

This project illustrates an intended consumption pattern of the Kerberos 
Android app available from https://github.com/cqcallaw/kerberos-app

In particular, the project illustrates how to use content (credentials cache
and configuration) provided by a Kerberos content provider.

===============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

Before building or installing this package, you must have the Android SDK
and NDK installed and set up on your system. It is also helpful to have the
Android Emulator set up and configured with an Android platform greater
than or equal to version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). For details on downloading and 
setting these up, please see the following links:

SDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
NDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Emulator: https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html

An operational Kerberos realm and a provider of a Kerberos credentials cache
and configuration (e.g. https://github.com/cqcallaw/kerberos-app) must also be 
present.

===============================================================================
BUILDING

To build the package:

1) Update the Android project:

	android update project -p . -s
	
2) Configure the NDK by setting the ndk.dir environment variable in 
local.properties

3) Initialize submodules:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	
4) Compile:

	ant debug

===============================================================================
INSTALLING

Install as you would any other Android app.

RUNNING

The included example server (derived from 
http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/SampleServer.java)
can be configured and executed with the provided SampleServer.sh script. 

At minimum, one must modify the -Djava.security.krb5.realm and -Djava.security.krb5.kdc
arguments in the shell script, and the principal in the bcsLogin.conf file. It
may also be necessary to modify the path to the keytab in the bcsLogin.conf file.

The sample server typically requires root privileges.

Once the sample server is running, a credentials cache must be obtained. This
is typically done by running the kinit operation of the Kerberos app.

Once the sample server is running and listening for connections and the content
provider has obtained a credentials cache, the sample client can run. The 
display window will show a trace of the interaction with the server.

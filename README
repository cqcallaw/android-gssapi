A Sample GSSAPI Client

This project illustrates an intended consumption pattern of the Kerberos 
Android app available from https://github.com/cqcallaw/kerberos-app

In particular, the project illustrates how to use content (credentials cache
and configuration) provided by the Kerberos app.

Android Emulator set up and configured with an Android platform greater
than or equal to version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). For details on downloading and 
setting these up, please see the following links:

SDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
NDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Emulator: https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html

An operational Kerberos realm must also be present.

RUNNING

The included example server (derived from 
http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/SampleServer.java)
can be configured and executed with the provided SampleServer.sh script. 

At minimum, one must modify the -Djava.security.krb5.realm and -Djava.security.krb5.kdc
arguments in the shell script, and the principal in the bcsLogin.conf file. It
may also be necessary to modify the path to the keytab in the bcsLogin.conf file.

The sample server typically requires root privileges.

Once the sample server is running and listening for connections, the sample 
client can run. The display window will show a trace of the interaction with 
the server.
